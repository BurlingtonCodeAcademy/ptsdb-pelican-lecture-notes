// PROVISO 1. JS HAS CHANGED A LOT OVER THE YEARS

// When browsing code online, especially older code,
// ESPECIALLY code before 2015,
// you will notice a few differences
//   WHY? because newer features of JS did not exist yet

// Old way to declare variables:
var x = 10

const lesson = "var: just don't use it!"
// see previous line for moral of story



// PROVISO 2: THE SEMICOLON QUESTION

// traditionally, almost all statements in JS ended in semicolons
// (this comes from JS having syntax similar to C and Java)

let anotherVariable = 14 * 2;  // note the semicolon at the end of the statement

// Baaaasically, you don't need them.
// BUT: if you want to use them, that's ok.
// It could be clearer for you to read, or just match online code examples more,
//   reason is up to you,

const proviso2Part1 = 'THE CHOICE '
const proviso2Part2 = 'IS YOURS';
const proviso2Addendum = '...but BE CONSISTENT!!!';

console.log('moral is ' + proviso2Part1 + proviso2Part2 + proviso2Addendum)
