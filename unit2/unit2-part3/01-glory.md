   Legends speak of a task set to new programmers of old,
 with directions handed down between generations on end.
By proving oneself upon this quest,
      you may truly call yourself a computer programmer.
  Do not fear, you can conquer this first of many great
and glorious challenges and in so bring honor to your house.
You will tell your great-great-grandchildren stories of this day.

             Prepare thyself for

      ______ _         ____                
     |  ____(_)       |  _ \               
     | |__   _ _______| |_) |_   _ ________
     |  __| | |_  /_  /  _ <| | | |_  /_  /
     | |    | |/ / / /| |_) | |_| |/ / / / 
     |_|    |_/___/___|____/ \__,_/___/___|.



To aid you on this quest you will need three, uh, crystals.

1. For loops
2. If-Else statements
3. ???? (but we mentioned it earlier)


## THE TASK BEFORE YOU

Write a JavaScript file that, when run,

- prints out the numbers 1 to 100, HOWEVER,
- if the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead.
- If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead.
- And, if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 (e.g. 15), print "FizzBuzz"

Go!


## Suggestions.

Think about:

- How can I make sure only one thing is printed out for every number between 1 and 100?
- What kind of loop would work best here?
- Which condition should I check for first?



Test, test, test!

Make sure your code is doing what you expect.


(If you are completely stuck, do not fear,
you have plenty of time to get this right
and you will learn from the experience regardless.)
