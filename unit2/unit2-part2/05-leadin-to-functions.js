// What if we have code we want to execute over and over again?

// a function is a code block that we can run with different arguments

// a function statement look like this

// tHiS iS a WoRd

function printWordLength (word) {
  console.log(word.length)
}

// all a function is is a code block (i.e. sequence of statements)
// that can be "called", that is, executed or run
// with different values for each of the arguments
// (arguments essentially being variables)

printWordLength('aardvark')

// The motivation here is that we don't want to repeat ourselves.
